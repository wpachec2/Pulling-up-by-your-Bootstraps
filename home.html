                It's safe to say that life as been pretty crazy thus far, especially
                recently. I've decided to take quite a different path after living the
                Manufacturing like for close to eight years now. I've seen and
                experienced a lot that have really affected how i view people, my
                surroundigs and the world and what I want to make out of it. I took up
                Grand Circus with the hopes that the mundane life I fell victim to would
                finally change.

            <p>
                These steps toward Software Developer have been a extreme adjustment to
                say the least.. It's been a very long time since I've really had to
                apply myself in any serious manner and Grand Circus has tested my
                resolve many times to that end. I stated strong, or so I thought, until
                reaching our second assessment and realizing there was soo much more to
                grasp. These last few checkpoints have proven that I do have what it
                takes so I'll do my best to make the most of this move.

            <p>
                Growing up was tough, though I suppose it's that but different for everyone. I grew up in Romulus
                originally and after my parents adopted my younger brother and sister, we made the move to Canton. It was hard
                finding a place and new friends but with time that all came. I went to High School at PCEP where having to
                travel between buildings and passing hundreds of people you'll never meet became the norm. But life goes on.
